How to write data files:
- All the data files are YAML files. You'd better learn more about YAML before you write them. 
- The data files are in the 'yaml' folder
  the 'dia' folder is for dialy dialogs, 
  the 'nom' folder is for nomarl information,
  the 'sec' folder is for security information only for super users. 

Examples: 

que:
- how are you?
- how do you do?
ans:
 - Fine, thank you.
 - I am OK.

que:
- hello
ans: |
  Hi, 
  I'm fine, 
  thanks

Attention:
- 'que' items must all be lower case and without any punctuations. 
- 'ans' items will display randomly, but display all at once if you use 'ans: |'. 
- You should not write ':' in 'ans' items or it will be error when insert the data. 
- add ' when your yaml data is start with [ and end with ].

After create YAML files:
- Run insert_data.py to insert yaml files into databse. 
- You can use show_data.py to check the database.
