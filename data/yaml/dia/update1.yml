que: 
- what about go
ans: The chinese and japanese game of go is also a board game in which theplayers take turns moving. go exposes the weakness of our presentunderstanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing.go programs are very bad players, in spite of considerable effort (not asmuch as for chess). the problem seems to be that a position in go has to bedivided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzedseparately followed by an analysis of their interaction. humans use this inchess also, but chess programs consider the position as a whole. chessprograms compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doingthousands or, in the case of deep blue, many millions of times as muchcomputation.sooner or later, ai research will overcome this scandalous weakness.

que: 
- what about chess
ans: Alexander kronrod, a russian ai researcher, said ``chess is thedrosophila of ai.'' he was making an analogy with geneticists' use of thatfruit fly to study inheritance. playing chess requires certain intellectualmechanisms and not others. chess programs now play at grandmaster level, butthey do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by ahuman chess player, substituting large amounts of computation forunderstanding. once we understand these mechanisms better, we can buildhuman-level chess programs that do far less computation than do presentprograms.unfortunately, the competitive and commercial aspects of making computersplay chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain. itis as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races andconcentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win theseraces.

que: 
- what about miss
ans: What about her?

que: 
- what about iq
ans: No. iq is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children.it is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain scoreto the child's age. the scale is extended to adults in a suitable way. iqcorrelates well with various measures of success or failure in life, butmaking computers that can score high on iq tests would be weakly correlatedwith their usefulness. for example, the ability of a child to repeat back along sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities,perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute withat once. however, ``digit span'' is trivial for even extremely limitedcomputers.however, some of the problems on iq tests are useful challenges for ai.

ans: Clear your mind.

que: 
- what is the goal for aiml
ans: Aiml (artificial intelligence markup language) is an xml specificationfor programming chat robots like alice using program b. the emphasisin the language design is minimalism. the simplicity of AIML makesit easy for non-programmers, especially those who already know html, to get started writing chat robots. one ambitious goal for AIML is that, if a number of people create their ownrobots, each with a unique area of expertise, program b can literally merge-sort them together into a superbot, automatically omitting duplicate categories. we offer the both the source code and the alice content, in order to encourage others will open source their chat robots as well, to contribute to the superbot. botmasters are also of course free to copy protect private chat robots.

que: 
- what is the theory
ans: Alice isconceptually not much more complicated that weizenbaum's eliza chat robot; the main differences are the much larger case base and thetools for creating new content by dialog analysis. alice is also part of the tradition of minimalist, reactive orstimulus-response robotics. mobile robots work best, fastest anddemonstrate the most animated, realistic behavior when their sensory inputs directly control the motor reactions. higher-level symbolicprocessing, search, and planning, tends to slow down the process too much for realistic applications, even with the fastest controlcomputers.
